Directions:
1. At least one box that moves right and left, bouncing off of each side of the screen.
2. When the box reaches the edge and turns around, it should also move down.
3. You will need a launcher at the bottom of the screen.
4. The launcher will “launch” projectiles at the box.
5. The launcher should move horizontally with the mouse.
6. Projectiles should move straight up from the launcher when the mouse is pressed down.
7. Hitting the box should at least have the box change color.
8. *Optional: Score, based either off of number of launches, the amount of time the game takes, or some aspect of this data.
